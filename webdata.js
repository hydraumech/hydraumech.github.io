Features: (1) The suspending bottle-neck clamping design make the bottle stable during the high-speedmoving conditions. By changing a few parts, it can meet the need of production of different types of bottles easily. (2) The new generation of stainless steel grab is adopted and the grabs have no contact with the area above the bottles screw thread. Nozzles in the grab can guarantee the complete wash of the interior of the bottle. (3) The advanced gravity filling technology used in this machine makes the filling quick, steady and accurate. (4) Magnetic torque is used for screw capping, and the power of screw capping can be adjusted steplessly. Capping is reliable and do no harm to the caps. (5) Advanced technologies, such as human-machine interface touch-screen and PLC program control are adopted in this machine. (6) All parts that have direct contact with the water are made of high quality stainless steel.

Washing, filling, and cap-pingcan be carried out on this machine. This machine has the following characteristics: scientific and reasonable design, bea-utiful appearance, complete function, convenient maintenance, and high automation. Features: (1) The suspending bottle-necks cramping design makes the whole production line more stable during the working process and it also avoids malfunctions caused by the differences ofthickness and height of the bottle. This design also dramatically reduces the required numberof changeable parts, makes it more convenient to change the types of bottles. (2) The advanced technologies from Germany and Italy are introduced. Isobaric filling technology is used in this machine. Filling is quick and the amount of the liquid can be controlled accurately. Also, the beverage-holding tank is fully-closed and the CIP in-terface is installed. (3) Magnetic torque is used for screw capping, and the power of screw capping can be adjusted steplessly. It can use constant power to screw the plastic caps and will not damage the caps. (4) Horizontal swirl wind-power cap-managing device is used to avoid damaging the surface of the cap. And when there is shortage of caps in the caps storage tank, caps will be fed automatically. (5) Human-machine interface touch-screen is adopted in this machine. The liquid level in the tank can be controlled automatically.The filling and capping will stop automatically when there is no bottle. (6) All parts that have direct contact with the beverages are made of high quality stainless steel. And the main electrical components are from famous international companies.

This series machine can also be used for the filling ofpurified and mineral water. Features: (1) The suspending bottleneck clamping design make the bottle stable during the high-speed moving conditions. By changing a few parts, it can meet the need of production of different types of bottles easily. (2) The new generation of stainless steel grab is adopted and the grabs have no contact with the area above the bottles screw thread. Nozzles in the grab can guarantee the complete wash of the interior of the bottle. (3) The advanced micro negative -pressure filling technology used in this machine makes the filling quick, steady and accurate. The beverage-holding tank is fully-closed and also, temperature-control device and CIP washing interface are installed (4) This machine can meet all the technical requirements for hot-filling below 95â„?And before capping, bottle-mouth will be cleaned by R.O. Washing device. (5) Magnetic torque is used for screw capping, and the power of screw capping can be adjusted steplessly. Capping is reliable and do no harm to the caps. (6) Advanced technologies, such as human-machine interface touch-screen and PLC computer program control are adopted in this machine. (7) All parts that have direct contact with the beverages are made of high quality stainless steel. And many critical components such as the decelerator, the motor, are from famous international companies.

In current product lines, the E series air units are similar to SMC A series air preparation units and are our most popular style air units with higher flow rates, simple assembly and maintenance reduces down time. E series air treatment units are available for 8 sizes options from M5 to 1â€?to ensure optimum performance,offering energy savings. Weâ€™ve already finished R&D for the combination of modular style air preparation equipment that best suit your needs. With standard 25 micron avalable and 5micron as opetional, E series air treatment units are a good replacement for SMC air units.

Instead, the internal piston is connected to an external carriage, by means of a magnetic or mechanical coupling system. With no external leakage, the SW series can be used in many diverse environments. Magnetically coupled cylinders have a wide range of applications, and save mounting space. Loads and moments are possible through the use of integrated guides. A variety of guides can be used to achieve the necessary accuracy or allowable moment needed for your application. SW is available in 9 bore sizes, from 6mm to 63mm with standard stokes up to 1000mm. The 5 different model variations offer widest application choice. Auto switches are integrated as standard.

Pressure control modular valves, flow control valves and check valves are widely used in various hydraulic systems. The modular valves equipped with solenoid directional valves and manifolds lessen some devices and save space. As various valves can be mounted or removed easily, addition or change of oil lines can be obtained quickly and conveniently. The hydraulic system composed of modular valves overcomes leakage, vibration and flowing noise. Such valves with orderly and good-looking appearance not only enhance the reliability, but also simplify the maintenance and checking process of hydraulic systems.

It contains a distributor valve, Gerotor gear set, and a pressure relief valve with the features of comfortable operation, compact volume and easy installation. It can be used in the fields of wheeled vehicle, large manual gate as well as other machineries required high torque. Distributor valve is open center and the power stream fluid circulates through the unit back to the tank at very low pressure when the system is not being steered. When the steering wheel is turned, fluid is led from the steering system pump via the distributor valve to the hydraulic energy (pressure, oil flow) into mechanical energy (torque, speed). The speed is controlled by the rate of rotation of the steering wheel. The torque on the output shaft is the sum of the manual input torque and the torque from the Gerotor gear set. When the steering wheel is stopped rotating, the distributor valve cuts off the fluid to the Gerotor gear set, and torque amplification is stopped. Order Code: BNF â€?å›?â‘?â‘?â‘?

Under load sensing steering system, the unit can instead of load sensing steering unit in same displacement. But as a steering control unit, steering displacement of model TLF will be changeable with input speed of steering wheel. There are three cases between effectivedisplacement of steering unit and speed of steering wheel as following: Effective displacement is the same volume of metereddisplacement at the low speed (range is less than 10rpm); Effective displacement is the more and the more with speed atthe medium speed (range is between 10 rpm and 40 rpm). Effective displacement is basic on constant volume at the highspeed (range is more than 40 rpm). It was used in the area of industry applications of articulated vehicles, which supplies unique advantages on such steering performance. Typical applications are Loader, Graders, Haulers, Tractors as well as the small-size vehicles. While the vehicles are being driven on the road, a small input speed of the steering wheel will not overcorrect steering. While increasing input speed will produce the additional volume of steering flow, the vehicles will be required to change the direction quickly. Model TLF1 coaxial flow amplifying steering unit is a hydrostatic steering unit with flow amplifying ability. It can be supplied by various flow suppliers, and composed various load sensing hydraulic steering systems with priority valves, crossover anticavitation relief valves and other elements, which have light operation, sensitive and smooth features, and used in large and medium loaders, bulldozers, tractors, architectural machinery, engineering machinery, lifting machinery and other off-the-highway vehicles as well as hydraulic rudder of ship. It also provides the following features: Compact volume and light weight Good adjusting characteristic and small pressure loss Convenient mounting and reasonable price Instead of load sensing steering unit in same displacement without changing construction and exchangingother elements.
