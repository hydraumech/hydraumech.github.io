                            <p>BZZ series hydraulic steering unit is consisted of  one pair of rotary valve and one pair of 
                              gerotor. Via the steering column, the steering unit links the steering wheel, when the steering 
                              wheel rotates, the oil flows out of the supply pump of the steering system  , through the rotary 
                              valve and the gerotor , to the cylinder’s port left or right ( depend upon the rotation direction). 
                              The gerotor supplies the oil to the steering cylinder in proportion to the angular rotation of the 
                              steering wheel. If the oil flow out of the supply pump of the steering system is too small, the <br>
                              steering unit can work as the manual pump.<br>

                              Model BZZ5 load sensing steering with&nbsp;BZZ1/BZZ2/BZZ3 advantages, also has following features: <br />
Provide reliable, smooth pressure compensated steering, because pressure variations in the steering circuit do not affect steering response or maximum steering rate, and the steering circuit always has flow priority <br />
Only the flow required by the steering maneuver goes to the steering circuit. Flow not required for steering is available for use in the auxiliary circuit. Therefore power loss is decressed, system efficency is increased. </p>
