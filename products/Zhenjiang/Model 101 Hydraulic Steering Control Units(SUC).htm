                            <p>Hydraulic Steering Unit 10 series is widely used in the steering control system of different kinds of engineering vehicles, such as the steering system of many kinds of industrial and agricultural mobile machinery forklift, loader, road roller, tractor, combine harvester, and the ship helm etc. The steering unit can control the steering cylinder with bigger resistance force by inputting minor force; It’s easier, flexible and reliable; The integral check valve can prevent the system pressure oil from anti-vibration, and prevent from “hit-hand” during the steering operation; Integral pressure control valve can control the operation pressure and the shock pressure of the steering system.</p>
                            <p><strong>Characteristic Features</strong>: <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101 series SUC, which inherit the basic function of steering system not from besign structure but also on principle, have all the following valve functions incorporated with the housing of SUC: <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check valve inlet-port <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relief valve <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dual shockproof valve <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dual suction valve <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series SUC are not integrated with Blocks as usual, convenient operating and provide any of mounting data as international standard.
