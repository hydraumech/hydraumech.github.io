Being a combinatory valve, it can bolt directly to the port face of model BZZ steering unit to form a complete set, contains dual shockproof valves to protect the steering unit, hoses and steering cylinder form excessive system pressure due to sudden shock forces at the vehicle wheels and prevent such forces from being transmitted to the steering wheel, it also contains suction valves to help prevent cavitation at the low pressure side of the cylinder, an inlet check valve prevents reversed flow load circuit, a relief valve is the protection of the pump. </p>
