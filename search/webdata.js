Instead, the internal piston is connected to an external carriage, by means of a magnetic or mechanical coupling system. With no external leakage, the SW series can be used in many diverse environments. Magnetically coupled cylinders have a wide range of applications, and save mounting space. Loads and moments are possible through the use of integrated guides. A variety of guides can be used to achieve the necessary accuracy or allowable moment needed for your application. SW is available in 9 bore sizes, from 6mm to 63mm with standard stokes up to 1000mm. The 5 different model variations offer widest application choice. Auto switches are integrated as standard.

Pressure control modular valves, flow control valves and check valves are widely used in various hydraulic systems. The modular valves equipped with solenoid directional valves and manifolds lessen some devices and save space. As various valves can be mounted or removed easily, addition or change of oil lines can be obtained quickly and conveniently.

It can be used in the fields of wheeled vehicle, large manual gate as well as other machineries required high torque. Distributor valve is open center and the power stream fluid circulates through the unit back to the tank at very low pressure when the system is not being steered. When the steering wheel is turned, fluid is led from the steering system pump via the distributor valve to the hydraulic energy (pressure, oil flow) into mechanical energy (torque, speed). The speed is controlled by the rate of rotation of the steering wheel. The torque on the output shaft is the sum of the manual input torque and the torque from the Gerotor gear set. When the steering wheel is stopped rotating, the distributor valve cuts off the fluid to the Gerotor gear set, and torque amplification is stopped. &lt; BACK Copyright &copy; 2013.

Under load sensing steering system, the unit can instead of load sensing steering unit in same displacement. But as a steering control unit, steering displacement of model TLF will be changeable with input speed of steering wheel. There are three cases between effectivedisplacement of steering unit and speed of steering wheel as following: Effective displacement is the same volume of metereddisplacement at the low speed (range is less than 10rpm); Effective displacement is the more and the more with speed atthe medium speed (range is between 10 rpm and 40 rpm). Effective displacement is basic on constant volume at the highspeed (range is more than 40 rpm). It was used in the area of industry applications of articulated vehicles, which supplies unique advantages on such steering performance. Typical applications are Loader, Graders, Haulers, Tractors as well as the small-size vehicles. While the vehicles are being driven on the road, a small input speed of the steering wheel will not overcorrect steering. While increasing input speed will produce the additional volume of steering flow, the vehicles will be required to change the direction quickly. Model TLF1 coaxial flow amplifying steering unit is a hydrostatic steering unit with flow amplifying ability. It can be supplied by various flow suppliers, and composed various load sensing hydraulic steering systems with priority valves, crossover anticavitation relief valves and other elements, which have light operation, sensitive and smooth features, and used in large and medium loaders, bulldozers, tractors, architectural machinery, engineering machinery, lifting machinery and other off-the-highway vehicles as well as hydraulic rudder of ship. It also provides the following features: Compact volume and light weight Good adjusting characteristic and small pressure loss Convenient mounting and reasonable price Instead of load sensing steering unit in same displacement without changing construction and exchangingother elements. &lt; BACK Copyright &copy; 2013.
